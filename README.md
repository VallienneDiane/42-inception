Docker is a popular open-source project. It is a container engine that uses the Linux Kernel features like namespaces and control groups to create containers on top of an operating system. Docker is a technology or a tool developed to manage containers efficiently.

Docker has an efficient workflow for moving the application from the developer’s laptop to the test environment to production.
It is incredibly fast, and it can run on any host with compatible Linux Kernel.

Docker engine comprises the docker daemon, an API interface, and Docker CLI. 

To manage images and run containers, dockerd calls the docker-containerd APIs.

The Daemon receives commands from the Docker client using the CLI or REST API. 
Docker daemon runs continuously as dockerd systemd service. It is responsible for building the docker images.

### Some installations to do in the virtual machine :

	su –
	cat /etc/sudoers -> add login to get root rights

	sudo apt-get install git
	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
	sudo apt-get install docker.io
	sudo usermod -aG docker $USER -> give sudo right to user

### Install last version docker-compose
	sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.28.5/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

A Dockerfile is a script that automatically creates containers on the Docker platform. 

A Dockerfile is basically a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. 

A Docker image is a file used to execute code in a Docker container.

The purpose of a Dockerfile is to create an image using several instructions

		FROM: from the base image
		RUN: launches the commands (update, installation of nginx pe)
		ENV: define env variables
		EXPOSE: exhibits container ports
		VOLUME: definition of volumes
		COPY: copy elements between host and container
		ENTRYPOINT: master process

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 

With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Docker Compose is used for running multiple containers as a single service. Each of the containers here run in isolation but can interact with each other when required.

- Build context
	The docker build command builds Docker images from a Dockerfile and a “context”. A build's context is the set of files located in the specified PATH or URL .

- Volumes
	Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure and OS of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker.

- Depends on
	depends_on is a Docker Compose keyword to set the order in which services must start and stop.

- Network
	In terms of Docker, a bridge network uses a software bridge which allows containers connected to the same bridge network to communicate, while providing isolation from containers which are not connected to that bridge network.

- .env
	ENV is mainly meant to provide default values for your future environment variables. Running dockerized applications can access environment variables. It's a great way to pass configuration values to your project. ARG values are not available after the image is built.
